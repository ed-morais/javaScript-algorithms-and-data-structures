// Frequency Counter - validAnagram
// Given two strings, write a function to determine if the second string is
// an anagram of the first. An anagram is a word, phrase, or name formed
// by rearranging the letters of another, such as cinema, formed from iceman.
// Note: You may assume the string contains only lowercase alphabets.

// Time Complexity - O(n)

function anagram (arr1, arr2) {
  if (length.arr1 !== length.arr2) {
    console.log('Words have different lengths')
