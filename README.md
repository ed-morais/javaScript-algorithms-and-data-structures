# Welcome to the exercises repository for Colt Steele's JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures course! 

This repository serves as a storage for all the exercises and files from the course. The course is designed to help you master advanced topics like dynamic programming, heaps, graphs, and Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm through practical exercises and implementation of various algorithms and data structures in JavaScript. 

In this repository, you will find:
- A variety of coding challenges and problems to practice analyzing time and space complexity using Big O notation
- Recursive exercises to help you understand and implement recursion
- A 5-step approach to solving difficult coding problems
- Programming patterns to help you improve your problem solving skills
- Searching algorithms and sorting algorithms (bubble, selection, insertion, quick, merge, and radix sort) implemented in JavaScript
- Data structures (linked lists, trees, heaps, hash tables, and graphs) implemented from scratch
- Exercises to help you traverse trees and graphs and cover Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm
- Dynamic Programming exercises

To get the most out of this repository, it is recommended that you have a basic understanding of JavaScript syntax and have completed the course.

Please note that this repository is intended to be used as a supplement to the course and does not include solutions or walkthrough videos.
